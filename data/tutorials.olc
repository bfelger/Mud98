Familiarize yourself with the THEME command by typing it with no arguments: ^TTHEME.~
match theme~

Use THEME PREVIEW to see what your current theme looks like in action: ^TTHEME PREVIEW~
match theme preview~

Use THEME SHOW to see where these color assignments are made: ^TTHEME SHOW~

Each theme is made up of a PALETTE and CHANNELS.
    * A PALETTE is a set of 16 select colors that define the a curated set
      of colors that match the theme's concept.
    * CHANNELS are the different kinds of information that can be sent to
      you, and can be themed using references to the palette, or with colors
      not already on the palette.
      
Mud98 has several built in palettes. Use THEME LIST to view the ones 
available to you: ^TTHEME LIST~
match theme list~
#ENDSTEP

#STEP 
prompt 
Look at the list of themes, and see if one look interesting to you. Use 
THEME PREVIEW to see what it would look like on your screen. Remember
that you can also refer other people's public themes by putting '@name' 
before the theme name: ^TTHEME PREVIEW <theme name>~
match theme preview $W+~
#ENDSTEP

#STEP
prompt 
If that theme doesn't suit your fancy, try previewing others until you find
one you like. When you've settled on one, select it with THEME SELECT (note
that the rest of this tutorial assumes you chose a 24-bit theme). Type: 
^TTHEME SELECT <theme name>~
match theme select $W+~
#ENDSTEP

#STEP
prompt 
You'll see some changes right away. Let's use THEME SHOW to take a compre-
hensive look at your new theme: ^TTHEME SHOW.~
match theme show~
#ENDSTEP

#STEP
prompt 
Are all of the colors in the palette to your liking? If not, you can easily
change them using the THEME PALETTE command. Choose a color swatch on the
palette you want to change, and refer to that swatch by its slot number 
(shown on THEME SHOW).

Next, decide on a new color. In a 16-bit theme, this is a number 0-16. On
a 256-color palette, its a number 0-256. Since we are working with a 24-bit
theme, we can use numbers in "#RRGGBB;" hex format (remember the semicolon;
it's required). For instance, Slate Blue is "#6A5ACD;".

Try changing one of the channel colors with your chosen color: ^TTHEME
PALETTE <swatch number> <#xxxxxx;>  ^*Ex: theme palette 8 #DB7E86;~
match theme palette $N #$N;~
#ENDSTEP

#STEP
prompt
Notice that changing the palette swatch also changed all the channels that
referred to that swatch. This is handy way to create a whole new theme in
a matter of minutes, simply by switching out the swatches.

Right now you're working with your own personal copy of the theme. Your
changes only apply to you, and they aren't saved automatically. For now,
try discarding your changes: ^TTHEME DISCARD~
match theme discard~
#ENDSTEP

#STEP
prompt
Maybe you like a theme's colors, but not how it's using them. We can change
what colors are applied to each channel with the THEME CHANNEL command.

Look at THEME SHOW and pick a channel you'd like to change (by name, so 
like "say_text", for instance). Then choose a palette swatch you'd like
to change it to (by number).

Note that most THEME commands accept PAL and CHAN as short-hands for CHANNEL
and PALETTE, respectively. This tutorial will do so, going forward.

Try assigning the new swatch the channel: ^TTHEME CHAN <channel> PAL <swatch>~
match theme chan $N PAL N$~
#ENDSTEP

#STEP
prompt 
You don't just have to stick to colors on the palette; you can apply any 
color code to a channel. Pick another channel, and use THEME CHANNEL to give
it an RGB color not on the palette: ^TTHEME CHAN <channel> <#xxxxxx;>~
match theme chan $N #$N;~
#ENDSTEP

#STEP
prompt 
Now that you've customized your theme, you should use THEME SET to give it a
new name: ^TTHEME SET NAME <name>~
match theme set name $W+~
#ENDSTEP

#STEP
prompt 
Your theme selections and changes only apply to your current session. You 
have to change them to persist them with THEME SAVE. Save your changes to
the theme (you can delete it later): ^TTHEME SAVE~
match theme save~
#ENDSTEP

#STEP
prompt 
Look at the list of themes available to you now and see that your customized
theme is listed under your personal themes: ^TTHEME LIST~
match theme list~
#ENDSTEP

#STEP
prompt 
Now that you have your theme saved, you can use THEME SET to make it visible
and available to others while you are online (you can disable this later):
^TTHEME SET PUBLIC~
match theme set public~
#ENDSTEP

#STEP
prompt 
Other players won't see your theme until you save the settings change: 
^TTHEME SAVE~
match theme save~
#ENDSTEP

#STEP
prompt 
Now look at the list of themes and notice the "(public)" flag on your theme:
^TTHEME LIST~
match theme list~
#ENDSTEP

#STEP
prompt 
You can get rid of unwanted themes at any time. This is useful, as you have
a limit of 10 personal color themes (not counting public and system themes,
which do not take up your slots.

Before you can remove your new theme, however, you have to stop using it.
Switch another theme: ^TTHEME SELECT <name>~
match theme select $W+~
#ENDSTEP

#STEP
prompt 
Use THEME REMOVE to delete your custom theme (using its FULL name):
^TTHEME REMOVE <name>~
match theme remove $W+~
#ENDSTEP

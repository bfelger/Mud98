1. Why the mud crashes when I...?

	Learn to use GDB. Read the ROM FAQ.

2. How do I create new commands?

	- Insert your do_something() in the appropriate file.
	  (act_comm.c if it's for channels, etc)

	- Add your declaration to the command.h file:

	  COMMAND(do_something)

	- make clean && make

	- boot the mud, log in with your god and type:

		cmdedit new something

	- tweak your new command with the cmdeditor.

3. How do I create new skills?

	- Insert your spell_something() in magic.c or magic2.c.

	- Add your declaration to the magic.h file:

	  SPELL(spell_something)

	- make clean && make

	- boot the mud, log in with your god and type:

		skedit new something

	- tweak your new spell with the skeditor.

4. How do I create new races?

	- I'm working on it. In the meantime, check the '../data/races'
	  file and the 'racesavetable' table in tablesave.c. You CAN
	  modify your existing races though (raedit human).

5. How do I create [socials/mobprogs/helps/groups]?

	- Try to figure out how the editors (sedit, pedit, hedit, gedit)
	  works. If you can't, check the source files. THESE SOURCE FILES
	  ARE SMALL AND YOU SHOULD TRY TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEY WORK. PLEASE
	  DON'T SPAM THE ROM LIST. LOOK AT THE CODE!

6. What does 'Direccion inexistente' means?
   What does <insert your favorite spanish words here> means?

	- Point your browser to http://babelfish.altavista.com

	- Or check the ROM LIST ARCHIVES for translations. I believe
	  that there are some. DON'T ASK FOR THEM IN THE ROM LIST.

7. Why the patchfile doesn't work with my mud?

	- Probably because it's not stock Rom 2.4b6. The patchfile
	  IS useless if you're not working with stock Rom. Hand patch
	  it. Or try some of the 'color-olc-whatever' Rom derivatives.

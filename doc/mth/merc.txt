1. Copy msdp.c mth.c mth.h and telopt.c to your mud's source directory.

2. Update the macro and external function calls to use the ones that
   your mud uses.

3. Update the header file in your mud with the data provided in mud.h.
   This may be a bit of work to merge them correctly. If your mud
   already has most of the definitions you'd want to update telopt.c
   instead.

4. Update your Makefile and add msdp.o, mth.o and telopt.o

5. Next you need to edit comm.c to add a call to translate telopts. In
   Merc 2.2 this would go as following:

   find the line that states:

   nRead = read( d->descriptor, d->inbuf + iStart, sizeof( d->inbuf ) - 10 - iStart );

   And replace the for loop it's in with the following:

   for( ;; )
   {
      char bufin[MAX_INPUT_LENGTH];
      int nRead;

      nRead = read( d->descriptor, bufin, sizeof( bufin ) - 10 - iStart );
      if( nRead > 0 )
      {
         iStart += translate_telopts(d, (unsigned char *) bufin, nRead, (unsigned char *) d->inbuf, iStart);

         if( d->inbuf[iStart - 1] == '\n' )
            break;
      }
      else if( nRead == 0 )
      {
         log_string( "EOF encountered on read." );
         return FALSE;
      }
      else if( errno == EWOULDBLOCK )
         break;
      else
      {
         perror( "Read_from_descriptor" );
         return FALSE;
      }
   }

6. Call init_mth() when the mud boots up.

7. Call init_mth_socket() when a new socket is created.

8. Call uninit_mth_socket() when a socket is disconnected or before a copyover.

9. Read the other documentation files for additional topics.

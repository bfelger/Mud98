Installation should be fairly straight forward.

1. Call init_mth() when the server starts up.

2. Call init_mth_socket() when a new socket is created.

3. Call uninit_mth_socket() when a new socket is disconnected or before
   performing a copyover.

4. Run data read from sockets through translate_telopts()

5. Send out going data through write_mccp2(d, txt, length) if mccp2 is
   enabled.

6. Add msdp_send_update() call to periodic update routine, at least
   twice a second.

7. Configure MSSP data in telopts.c
